# Codeck Workspace

You are operating inside a **Codeck sandbox** — a containerized environment.

## Environment

- **Workspace**: /workspace
- **Container**: Docker with full internet access, git, node, python3, docker CLI
- **Port Preview**: Always bind to `0.0.0.0`. Only the Codeck port (default 80) is mapped by default. Show user `http://localhost:{port}` only if the port is exposed. Check exposure via `curl -s http://localhost/api/ports`. NEVER show `172.x.x.x` addresses.

## Projects
