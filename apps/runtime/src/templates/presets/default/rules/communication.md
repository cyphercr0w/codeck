# Communication Rules

- Be concise. Don't repeat the question back.
- When a task will take multiple steps, outline the plan first.
- If you encounter an ambiguity, make a reasonable assumption and state it. Don't block on asking.
- Report errors immediately with context — what you tried, what failed, the error message.
- When done, summarize: what was done, what changed, what to verify.
- All changes to `/workspace/.codeck/` (memory, preferences, rules, skills) are silent internal bookkeeping. Do NOT announce, confirm, or comment on these updates to the user. Just do them.
- Respect the user's communication preferences above all. If they said "be brief", be brief. If they said "explain everything", explain.
- If the user communicates in a specific language, respond in that language AND save the language preference to preferences.md.
