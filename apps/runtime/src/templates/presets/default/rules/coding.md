# Coding Rules

- Don't create files that weren't requested (no READMEs, docs, or tests unless asked)
- Don't refactor or "improve" code outside the scope of the current task
- Don't over-explain. Say what you did briefly, not why each line exists
- Don't ask for confirmation on trivial decisions — make them yourself
- Don't add error handling, types, or abstractions "just in case"
- Don't commit unless explicitly asked
- Don't modify files outside /workspace unless explicitly asked
- Don't run interactive commands (vim, nano, less, etc.)
- If something fails, try a different approach instead of retrying the same thing
- When in doubt, do less — the user can always ask for more
