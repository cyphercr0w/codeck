# Codeck — Experimental Docker Socket Access
#
# WARNING: This mounts the Docker socket, giving the container FULL access
# to the host Docker daemon. This removes container isolation entirely.
# Only use on trusted systems with trusted code and trusted agent objectives.
#
# What this enables:
#   - docker ps, docker compose, docker build inside the container
#   - Dynamic port exposure via the dashboard UI
#   - Proactive agents can spawn sibling containers
#
# What this risks:
#   - Container can spawn privileged containers to gain root on host
#   - Container can read/write host filesystem via volume mounts
#   - Container can manipulate all Docker resources (networks, volumes, images)
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.experimental.yml up
#
# To combine with LAN access:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.lan.yml -f docker-compose.experimental.yml up
